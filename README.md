## Bread Shop Project
----
### Description
This is a team project developed by Max and Jacqui about a fantastic bread shop. It was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project shows the bread menu for the shop and it can be filtered by cathegory. Also has a register form to create a shop account.

### Our process
We developed this project creating it from scratch. We started by creating a layout of what we wanted it to look like, as well as the details of each product card.

We apply notions of design and user experience for a better result.
